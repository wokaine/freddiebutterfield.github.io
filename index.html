         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>
            Hi! I'm a fifth year student at the University of Sheffield studying MEng Computer Science (Software Engineering) with a Year in Industry. I am currently studying for my final year after just having completed my Year in Industry, which you can find more details about below.
            I am a committed and eager Jack of All Trades with a broad range of skills and competencies. I believe that no concept is too hard to grasp: there is always a point where it all clicks together - it just takes time.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            In my opinion, programming is a very forgiving practice. Everyone has experienced the missing semi-colon, the missing close quotes, or even forgetting to hit Ctrl+S. It's a practice where you are allowed to make mistakes, recuperate, and try again. And again. And again.
            As someone who constantly got marked down in school exams for silly mistakes, coding has allowed me and millions of others to learn from our mistakes, and show how much stronger we get when we learn from them.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>This website basically serves as a more detailed CV, feel free to look around.</p>

               <h3>QA Engineer Internship</h3>
               <p><em>Hewlett Packard Enterprise | Jul 2024 - Present</em></p>
               <p>
                  For my year in industry, I spent 13 months working for Hewlett Packard Enterprise in Bristol as a QA Engineer for HPE's primary storage products. 
                  The core of my job revolved developing and executing automated system tests in Python, the bulk of which were focused on a data migration feature which allows customers to migrate all their data from one array to another.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                  On top of that, I gained some experience in maintaining and configuring test infrastructure for the developers working on the storage virtualisation products. This involved using the Integrated Lights Out (iLO) to re-image ProLiant computers and subsequently running Ansible to fully configure them remotely.
                  This was definitely the best part of the job, not only for the responsibility, but it was always immensely satisfying helping the other developers with any station issues they came across.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                  As I study for my final year at University, I am currently continuing to work at HPE on a part-time remote basis.

               <p>For one semester I was an undergraduate demonstrator for the <b>Java Programming</b> module. My task was to help any students that needed help with the weekly learning material in allocated sessions.</p>

               <p><em>2009 - 2020</em></p>
               <p>
                  For around 11 years I attended an extracurricular performing arts school. Here I learned to sing, dance, and act and became a "triple threat". I performed annually in the school's musical productions, but also won roles in professional TV and theatre. Some highlights: 
               </p>
               <br>
               <ul>
                  <li>Dulcamara's Assistant in Opera North's L'Elisir d'Amore (Spring 2016)</li>
                  <li>Michael in Billy Elliot the Musical (West End) (Nov 2013 - Sep 2014)</li>
                  <li>"Ug" in Cbeebies' Gigglebiz (2013)</li>
                  <li>Hal in ITV's Eternal Law (2012)</li>
               </ul>
               <br>
               <p>
                  Unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic had brought this to an abrupt end, and I left the school at the end of 2020 to focus on my A-Level studies.

               <h3>Dissertation Project (2024)</h3>
               <p>
                  Developed a lyrics-based music recommendation system that uses 3 different word vectorisation methods: Word2Vec, GloVe, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Please be aware the app is currently not functioning properly. When it queries a song it looks for it in the dataset first, if not then it will scrape Genius lyrics. However, it seems that Genius have changed the HTML ID of their lyrics containers and so you currently can't query any songs outside the dataset.
