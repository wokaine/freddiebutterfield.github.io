                 For my dissertation project, I developed a lyrics-based music recommendation application. I trained 3 models: GloVe, Word2Vec, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on a dataset consisting of around 100,000 songs, then used those vectors to make a recommendation from a query song. To evaluate the project, I created a survey and allowed my peers to test my application.
